<h2>Configuration</h2>

  <accordion-group heading="In V1 there are 2 locations where I can set configuration info. Where Should I set it?">
	As explained above, this plugin is build on top of the AVRECLIPSE and CDT plugins. The plugin sets the "default Arduino settings" and groups all Arduino settings in one place.
	So when you change a Arduino setting; the plugin sets the CDT and AVRECLIPSE setting accordingly.<br/>
	The settings are only set when you set them (in other words they are not verified and corrected afterwards.)
	This means you can change them directly using the AVRECLIPSE and CDT functionality or indirectly using my plugin settings pages.
	One nice example to demonstrate this is in the preference page (<i>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Arduino &gt; Arduino</i>).
	This page contains the flag &quot;use Arduino ide tools in eclipse&quot;.<br/>
	If you set this flag the AVRECLIPSE plugin settings will be filled with the locations of the Arduino IDE (compiler/avr dude...).
	But you can still go to these settings  in the AVRECLIPSE pages and change them.Your changes will be in efffect even though the flag &quot;use Arduino ide tools in eclipse&quot; is set.
	By removing the flag and resetting the flag you can undo the changes you did.<br/>
	I hope this is clear.

  <accordion-group heading="Can I use the plugin with a version control tool?">
	Yes you can and should. <a href="https://jazz.net/products/rational-team-concert/">I use Rational team concert and github at the same time.</a>
	The best version control system available at this time.<br/>

  <accordion-group heading="What is this private library in the settings page?">
	In the settings page a private library folder is requested. This setting should point to a location where you down loaded Arduino libraries.<br/>
	If you haven't down loaded Arduino libraries yet do as follows:
	<ol>
		<li>Consider using the Arduino IDE. (strongly advised)</li>
		<li>Point it to a location where you can download Arduino libraries.</li>
	</ol>
