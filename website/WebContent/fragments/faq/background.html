  <accordion-group heading="Which version control system do you use?">
	I used to use Github and Rational team concert as it fits better with my needs.</br>
	Rational Team Concert is a great tool that allows to control the code at a high and low level at the same time. To me it outruns Github by far.

	Thanks for noticing there is quite some test work.
I use junit. The junit tests are in the github repository. running these takes a very long time.
