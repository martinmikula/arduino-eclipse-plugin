DON'T PANIC*
========
On the right you can see the steps needed to decide on what best fits your needs when running the Arduino Eclipse IDE.

But if you panic take the 32 bit product for your platform.

The first thing to do is decide on V1 versus V2 V3 or V4 (take V4) and plugin versus product.

Then you decide on the actual version of eclipse, Arduino eclipse IDE and Arduino IDE.

Then look at the OS specific info and reevaluate your decision.

>*It is said that despite its many glaring (and occasionally fatal) inaccuracies, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy itself has outsold the Encyclopedia Galactica because it is slightly cheaper, and because it has the words "DON'T PANIC" in large, friendly letters on the cover.
